0	4480	Hey, I'm Stanley. I'm a Stanford CS major. I did fun and engineering at Facebook.
4480	8560	Hey, I'm Andy. I'm also a Stanford CS major and I did platform engineering at Facebook.
8560	12480	I'm Evan. I was on the founding team of Vivo, the music video service.
12480	15120	And I'm Tony. I was a product editor at Square.
15120	19920	And the four of us came together about six months ago to work on software for small business owners.
19920	24160	But we didn't have a need at first, so we just went out and talked to all the small business owners we could find.
24160	30720	After over a hundred interviews, we came across a really interesting problem with small business restaurants in an area like this Palo Alto.
30720	36320	Yeah, so it turns out restaurants in Palo Alto don't deliver even though they really want to, but they can't afford it.
36320	42400	But their consumers are craving for it, but the places that the consumers love just can't deliver.
42400	48240	And we also found out about these delivery drivers who had a ton of spare time and they all wanted an extra cash during that downtime.
48240	60400	Right. And so that's when we built an initial product, Palo AltoDelivery.com. And how it worked is the customer goes to the website and places it online order that gets automatically sent to the restaurant.
60400	70400	And then we as a dispatchers with some pretty neat routing and batching algorithms where I would send the drivers efficiently to get the orders to the customers at a really fast time.
70400	77280	Yeah. And the four of us actually started off as delivery drivers and over time we hired more as we grew.
77280	84800	And in our first month of launch with not much marketing, we got over 150 paying customers in the Palo Alto area, which was really awesome.
84800	114640	And from that we generated over $10,000 in sales.
