Hey, I'm Stanley. I'm a Stanford CS major. I did fun and engineering at Facebook.

2
00:00:04,480 --> 00:00:08,560
Hey, I'm Andy. I'm also a Stanford CS major and I did platform engineering at Facebook.

3
00:00:08,560 --> 00:00:12,480
I'm Evan. I was on the founding team of Vivo, the music video service.

4
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:15,120
And I'm Tony. I was a product editor at Square.

5
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:19,920
And the four of us came together about six months ago to work on software for small business owners.

6
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:24,160
But we didn't have a need at first, so we just went out and talked to all the small business owners we could find.

7
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:30,720
After over a hundred interviews, we came across a really interesting problem with small business restaurants in an area like this Palo Alto.

8
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:36,320
Yeah, so it turns out restaurants in Palo Alto don't deliver even though they really want to, but they can't afford it.

9
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:42,400
But their consumers are craving for it, but the places that the consumers love just can't deliver.

10
00:00:42,400 --> 00:00:48,240
And we also found out about these delivery drivers who had a ton of spare time and they all wanted an extra cash during that downtime.

11
00:00:48,240 --> 00:01:00,400
Right. And so that's when we built an initial product, Palo AltoDelivery.com. And how it worked is the customer goes to the website and places it online order that gets automatically sent to the restaurant.

12
00:01:00,400 --> 00:01:10,400
And then we as a dispatchers with some pretty neat routing and batching algorithms where I would send the drivers efficiently to get the orders to the customers at a really fast time.

13
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:17,280
Yeah. And the four of us actually started off as delivery drivers and over time we hired more as we grew.

14
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:24,800
And in our first month of launch with not much marketing, we got over 150 paying customers in the Palo Alto area, which was really awesome.

15
00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:54,640
And from that we generated over $10,000 in sales.
